        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Norlyn, a Website Builder & Developer Support Specialist.</p>
        <p>I started my journey as a Chemical Engineer but found my passion in the digital world. Since 2018, I’ve been helping businesses and individuals create functional, responsive websites—starting with hand-coding using HTML, CSS, and jQuery and later specializing in WordPress page builders like Elementor and DIVI.
        </p>
        <p>Today, I focus on building websites with page builders, assisting developers in managing websites, and handling content updates to keep websites running smoothly. Whether you need a well-structured website, help troubleshooting minor issues, or ongoing website management, I’m here to support your online presence effectively.</p>
        <p>Let’s build and maintain a website that works for you!</p>
