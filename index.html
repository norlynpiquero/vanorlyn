        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Norlyn Piquero, a Chemical Engineer turned Freelancer with a passion for the digital world. Since 2018, I’ve been helping businesses and individuals create functional, responsive websites, starting with hand-coding using HTML, CSS, and a bit of jQuery.</p> 
            <p>Over time, I focused on building WordPress sites using page builders like Elementor and DIVI.</p>

        <p>As I transition into a Technical Virtual Assistant role, I now focus on providing crucial support to help online businesses run smoothly.</p> 
        <p>Whether it’s managing websites, updating content, troubleshooting technical issues, or assisting with various digital tasks, I’m here to help you succeed while ensuring everything works behind the scenes.</p>

                <p>"In today’s online world we are connecting and utilising ‘Freelance’ talent from all around the globe. Trust is one of the biggest factors when engaging with ‘offshore talent’. I’ve had the pleasure of engaging Norlyn’s online services for sometime and she has been nothing short of brilliant. Completely trustworthy and does what she says or agrees to 100% of the time. She delivers on-time, producing first-class first work. Her English is fluent (written and spoken), she understands and uses technology well and is willing to learn new programs and technology when required.
